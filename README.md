# packet_drop_analyze

Have been noticing a ton of packet drops at certain times on my home network so creating something here with the hopes
of having it look at ping stats to Google DNS servers over time. Ultimate goal is to be able to look at packet drops per
minute of each day to see if there's any correlation to specific times of the day and more/less drops. Then show my ISP
that I'm not crazy.

Also focusing on typehinting, comments/organization and writing my first tests!
